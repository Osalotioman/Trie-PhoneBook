# Trie-PhoneBook
A minimalistic Phonebook web app with trie data structure for searching through contacts.

## Basic features
- Search contact by *prefix*.
- View contact card.
- Create new contact.
- Permanently store contacts on remote server if user is online, so pretty reliable.

## Disclaimer
- Putting in your personal details is at your own risk, its just a fun project, don't over do it.
<!-- Temporary storage Implemented with local storage, so it's not so reliable.-->

## Note
There is no calling and stuff. You can consider it a template kind of thing.
